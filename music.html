        <p>
            Each year, five million Americans seek emergency medical care for traumatic brain injury (TBI), a major cause of death and disability overall and a leading cause in young adults. The harmful effects of TBI can manifest over the long-term as mood/attention disorders, cognitive impairment and suicidality. The best course of treatment is often difficult to determine due to the complexity of TBI presentations and the nonlinear relationship between patient data and phenotypes. One survey found that only 37% of healthcare providers believed they could make an accurate prognosis and 67% believed a better predictive model would change how they handle patients. Therefore, developing better TBI approaches will have a large impact on the health of Americans. 

            Recent advances in computing and machine learning have made it possible to process and learn from large-scale healthcare datasets. For example, a clinical sepsis model has already made an impact at Duke Health. However, appropriate management and care of TBI presents complex challenges that other treatment processes do not. Therefore, to successfully employ a new model, it is critical to cultivate early engagement with stakeholders and leverage their input for a detailed assessment of the care pathway and the data it generates.   </p>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
     
        <p>Born and brought up in Boston, USA, I started learning violin from Vid. Smt. Tara Anand at
                the young age of 8. In 2009, after relocating to Bangalore, I began learning from Vid. Smt.
                Lalgudi Rajalakshmi followed by Vid. Sri Yashasvi and currently under the tutelage of Legendary Padmasri
                A. Kanyakumari. Along with my brother Tejas Manjunath, known as Boston Brothers,
                have performed over 450 violin duet concerts extensively in India, USA, and Singapore, and had the honor to share the stage with our teacher Vid. A. Kanyakumari. We
                have won several accolades such as 1st place Violin Duet at Sangeeth Samraat (Chennai) reality
                show on Sankara TV, 1st prize Pratibhakankshi award, Nada Chintamani and many more. We had the honor to
                perform at the prestigious Rama Seva Mandali – Fort High School, Chennai December
                Music Season (Brahma Gana Sabha, Carnatica USA and Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha)
                Bangalore Ganesh Utsava, Alvas Nudisiri, Karavali Utsava, Puttaparthi- Prashanti Nilayam,
                Chowdiah Memorial Hall, Gayana Samaja, Shanmukhananda Hall- Bombay and many more.
                We have been featured in numerous national and regional newspapers such as The Hindu,
                The Indian Express, Deccan Herald, Prajavani, Vijaya Karnataka, Ee-Nadu, The Hans and
                television channels such as DD Chandana, Zee Kannada, and Colors Kannada. In 2018, I obtained
                First Rank in the highest proficiency Vidwath Music Examination conducted by the Karnataka
                State Music Board.

        <h2>Outputs</h2>
        <p>
         Qualitative publications on undertanding the challenges of TBI care and opporutnities to improve TBI using AI along with undersatnd clinician's perceptions of AI in the clinical settings.
         <br> 
         Quantitative publication resulting in an open source dataset of the curated TBI data with ML benchmarking on crucial TBI outcome variables.
        </p>

        <h2>Teaching a Class</h2>
        <p>
          To structure this project as an educational experience, we intentionally designed it as a class that deeply engaged students across multiple dimensions. Students participated in journal clubs to critically read and discuss papers on qualitative research methods, traumatic brain injury (TBI), artificial intelligence (AI), and AI applications in healthcare. To ensure a grounded understanding of real-world clinical practice, students shadowed 18 clinicians across the TBI care pathway, gaining firsthand insights into hospital workflows and patient care. The course featured guest lectures from leading experts in qualitative research, Health AI, data science, neuroanatomy, and frontline clinicians involved in TBI care. Students shared their learnings through midterm and final presentations, and also participated in interactive activities such as TBI trivia to reinforce key concepts in an engaging way.
